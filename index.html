        <h6 class="btn btn-danger variants_title">Alpha Variant</h6>
        <br><br>
        The Alpha strain is the most common variant of concern in Canada, accounting for more than 216,000 cases of COVID-19 across the country as of June 17.
        <br><br>
        First documented in the United Kingdom in September last year, Alpha is 50% more transmissible than earlier strains and was a major driver of Canadaâ€™s third wave of COVID-19 in the first months of 2021.

        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xm-6">
        <h6 class="btn btn-danger variants_title">Beta Variant</h6>
        <br><br>
        This variant can dodge some of the immune systemâ€™s defenses, but is still vulnerable to vaccines.
        <br><br>
        The Beta variant, formerly known as B.1.351, was first detected in South Africa last year. It contains several mutations, in a protein called spike, that help the virus bind more tightly to human cells.

        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xm-6">
        <h6 class="btn btn-danger variants_title">Gamma Variant</h6>
        <br><br>
        This variant known as Gamma or P.1 was first detected in Brazil.
        As shown with other UK and South African variants, the Brazilian variant has shown to enhanced transmissibility and is spreading globally.
        <br><br>
        The gamma variant was initially identified in Brazil in early January, and was found in the U.S. that same month. There are also other variants, such as the iota variant first identified in the United States and the lambda variant first seen in Peru, according to Wohl.

        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xm-6">
        <h6 class="btn btn-danger variants_title">Delta Variant</h6>
        <br><br>
        A SARS-CoV-2 mutation that originally surfaced in India. The first Delta case was identified in December 2020, and the strain spread rapidly, soon becoming the dominant strain of the virus in both India and then Great Britain.
        <br><br>
        The Delta variant is now surging ahead wherever control measures or vaccination supply and/or services are weak, doubling every two weeks in the United States. It is highly contagious and on a pathway to becoming the predominant strain. This puts many populations in a precarious position. A variant anywhere is a variant everywhere. The only way to get ahead and stay ahead of this virus and its variants is through vaccination. Yet globally, 7.2 billion people (90%) remain unvaccinated.
